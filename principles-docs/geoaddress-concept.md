Since coordinates are set based on the relative latency with other peers, but each peer can experience additional latencies regardless of its location, it is necessary to also adopt altitude as a subjective variable for each peer. Through various trigonometric calculations, a "unique ID" (calculated each time a peer connects) can be generated based on various more or less surrounding peers, but altitude can in turn reflect the relative proximity of each peer. In practice, the GeoAddress tends to dynamically create a landmass based on the order and latency of the various peers' network connections and without any real geographic references. Furthermore, the altitude itself will change completely independently of that of the landmass itself, but based on mathematical practicality in calculating efficient routes.
